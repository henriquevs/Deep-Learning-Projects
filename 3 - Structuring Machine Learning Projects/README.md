#Course 3 — Structuring Machine Learning Projects

This is a short two week optional course focusing on helping students how to structure a deep learning project. There was no programming assignment but it was full of expert tips on deep learning that you won’t find elsewhere, for example:

* How to decide the train/dev/test split of your dataset
* How to define human-level performance
* How to handle mis-matched training and dev/test data sets
* How to apply transfer learning, multi-task learning and end-to-end learning.

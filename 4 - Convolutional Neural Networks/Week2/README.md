# Week 2 Exercises

Week 2 - Case studies of various research papers in CNN for the classic networks: LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, Inception etc. We also learned about transfer learning, and data argumentation techniques such as mirroring, random cropping, rotation, shearing, local warping, color shifting and PCA color argumentation.

* At the first, we were introduced to Keras by a tutorial.

* In the second task, we used Keras to implement a neural networks for image classification using the ResNets architecture.

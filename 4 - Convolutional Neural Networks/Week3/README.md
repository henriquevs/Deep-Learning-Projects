# Week 3 Exercises

Week 3-apply CNNs to object detection.

Learned about the terminologies used in CNN such as padding, stride and filter etc, basic operations of CNN such as pooling, and how to build multi-class classification using CNN. There were two homework assignments : 

* Programming assignment was to implement car detection for autonomous driving. It was done in Keras using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to draw bounding boxes for object detection.

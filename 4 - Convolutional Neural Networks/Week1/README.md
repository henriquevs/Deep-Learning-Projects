# Week 1 Exercises

Week 1- foundation of CNN.

Learned about the terminologies used in CNN such as padding, stride and filter etc, basic operations of CNN such as pooling, and how to build multi-class classification using CNN. There were two homework assignments : 

* In the first assignment, we implemented convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in NumPy, including both forward propagation and backward propagation.

* In the second assignment, we built a TensorFlow sign language model (continuation from Course 2 week 3 assignment), this time with CNN it achieved almost 80% accuracy.

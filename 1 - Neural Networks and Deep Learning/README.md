# Course 1â€Š- Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Teaching the basics of neural networks and deep learning, such as forward and backward progradation.

This course has 4 weeks of materials and all the assignments are done in NumPy, without any help of the deep learning frameworks. 

This way we get a solid foundation of the fundamentals of deep learning under the hood, instead of relying on libraries.

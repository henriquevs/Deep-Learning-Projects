# Week 2 Exercises

Week 2 - Natural language Processing and Word Embeddings.

We learned how to use word vector and embedding for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and machine translation. Itâ€™s interesting to learn that just like humans, machine learning has gender, ethnicity and other biases; and we learned techniques for de-biasing.

We worked on these programming assignments:

* Implement a model that takes a sentence input and output an emoji based on the input.

* Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to __,

* Modiy word embeddings to reduce their gender bias.
